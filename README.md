The AI-based Smart Parking System is designed to optimize parking space usage and reduce time spent searching for a spot. 🚗💡 It uses advanced AI technologies, such as computer vision and machine learning, to monitor parking lots in real-time, providing valuable insights for both drivers and parking lot managers. Here's a quick overview of the project:

Real-time Parking Monitoring 🕒🔍: Using cameras and sensors, the system detects available parking spots and sends updates to drivers, helping them find a space more efficiently.

AI-Powered Detection 🤖📷: AI algorithms process camera feeds to recognize whether a parking space is occupied or available, enabling precise tracking of parking lot activity.

Smart Navigation 🧭🚙: The system guides drivers to the nearest available spot using a mobile app, reducing the time spent circling the lot and minimizing traffic congestion.

Data Analytics & Optimization 📊⚙️: The AI system collects data on parking patterns, which can be used to optimize parking lot design, pricing, and overall efficiency.

Automated Payment System 💳📲: Payments for parking are automated and integrated into the app, allowing drivers to pay digitally without the need for physical tickets.

Parking Space Reservation 📅📍: Drivers can reserve a parking spot ahead of time using the app, ensuring they always have a space when they arrive.
